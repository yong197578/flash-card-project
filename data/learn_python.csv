Term,Definition
Function,In Python a function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks promoting code reusability and readability
Variable,Variables in Python are memory references to store data values which means when you create a variable you reserve some memory space The data stored can be of various types including numbers strings lists and more
String,In Python a string is a sequence of Unicode characters They are immutable meaning that their content can't be changed after the string is created
List,Lists in Python represent ordered sequences of values They are mutable meaning elements inside a list can be changed after the list is created
Dictionary,Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of key-value pairs Each key must be unique and the keys are used to access the corresponding values
Loop,Loops allow for a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly based on a condition or a sequence of data Common loops in Python include the 'for' and 'while' loops
Class,In object-oriented programming a class defines a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure) providing initial values for its attributes and implementations of behavior (functions or methods)
Module,A module in Python refers to a single file containing Python statements and definitions Modules are a way to logically organize the Python code
Exception,Exceptions in Python are unexpected events that occur during the execution of a program They disrupt the normal flow of the program and if not handled will terminate the program
Tuple,A tuple in Python is similar to a list The difference between the two is that tuples are immutable meaning their elements cannot be modified after they are created
Set,A set is an unordered collection of items in Python Every element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed)
Lambda,Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword in Python They can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression
File Handling,File handling in Python involves creating reading updating or deleting files Python provides built-in functions and methods for this purpose
List Comprehension,List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists They consist of an expression followed by a 'for' clause and can have zero or more 'if' clauses
Slice,Slicing in Python refers to obtaining a subset of elements from an iterable based on start and stop indices
Global Variables,Global variables are variables declared outside any function and they can be accessed from any function in the program
Recursion,Recursion is a common programming technique wherein a function calls itself in order to solve a bigger problem in terms of smaller problems
Decorator,Decorators in Python are design patterns that allow you to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure They are a powerful tool for extending function or method behavior
Threading,Threading allows for concurrent execution of tasks In Python threading is achieved using the 'threading' module enabling multitasking
Property,In Python properties allow for the customization of access to instance data It’s a way to create setters getters and delete methods for an attribute in a class
Generators,Generators are a type of iterable in Python Unlike lists they produce items lazily and don't store the complete list in memory
Map & Filter,Map applies a function to all items in an input list and filter constructs a list from those elements of the list for which a function returns true
Metaclass,Metaclasses are classes of classes in Python They define how a new class is created and allow customization of class creation
Context Manager,A context manager in Python manages the resources like files or network connections ensuring that they are properly acquired and released typically used with the 'with' keyword
List Methods,List methods are the functions provided by Python to perform operations on lists such as appending counting or removing items
F-strings,Introduced in Python 36 f-strings (formatted string literals) allow for embedded Python expressions inside string literals using curly braces
Conditional Expressions,Also known as a ternary operator conditional expressions allow to return a value based on the truthiness of a Python expression
Docstrings,Docstrings are multi-line strings used right after the definition of a function method class or module They provide a convenient way to associate documentation with Python objects
Virtual Environment,A virtual environment is an isolated runtime environment that allows users to install packages locally avoiding potential conflicts with system-wide packages
Memory Management,Python uses a combination of a reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to manage memory and remove objects that are no longer referenced
Dunder Methods,These are special methods in Python with double underscores at the beginning and end of their names like `__init__` and `__str__` allowing for custom behaviors of built-in operations
Assert,The 'assert' keyword tests if a condition in your code returns True and if not the program will raise an AssertionError with an optional error message
Nesting,Nesting means defining something inside something else like defining functions inside functions or loops inside loops
Bytecode,Bytecode is the intermediate representation of source code that is executed by the Python interpreter
Garbage Collection,Garbage collection is the way Python manages memory automatically by clearing unreferenced objects ensuring efficient use of memory
Namespaces,A namespace in Python ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflict
Dynamic Typing,In Python the type of a variable is determined at runtime not in advance This means for instance a variable can be assigned as a number and then reassigned as a string
Slicing,This is a feature that enables accessing parts of sequences like strings tuples and lists
Enumeration,The enumerate function adds a counter to an iterable and returns an enumerate object
Packages,Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespaces by using “dotted module names”
Input & Output,This pertains to reading from and writing to the console or a file
Mutable & Immutable,These terms differentiate Python objects based on whether their content can be changed after creation
Boolean Logic,This deals with evaluating expressions that return either true or false
Inheritance,This is a feature of object-oriented programming where a class (child class) inherits properties and behavior from another class (parent class)
Regular Expressions,Regular expressions are sequences of characters that form search patterns They can be used to search edit or manipulate text
Closures,A closure in Python is a function object that remembers values even if they are not present in memory They are used in function factories
List Sorting,This refers to arranging elements of a list in a certain order (ascending or descending)
Stacks & Queues,These are data structures that follow the LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) principles respectively
Path Handling,Working with file and directory paths
Array,An array is a data structure that stores values of the same data type
Polymorphism,This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass
Python Shell,This is the interactive interpreter interface to Python
Dictionary Methods,These are methods attached to dictionary objects allowing operations like retrieval updation or deletion of key-value pairs
Unicode,This is an international encoding standard that represents text in computers
Multiple Assignment,This refers to assigning multiple variables simultaneously in one statement
Descriptors,Descriptors are Python objects that implement a method of an object's attribute access
Data Model,This refers to the architecture or layout where Python objects are organized and manipulated
Scope & Lifetime,These terms relate to the availability of a variable and the duration for which the variable exists in the memory
Error Types,These refer to various errors that can occur in Python like SyntaxError ValueError and TypeError
Bitwise Operators,These operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits They operate bit by bit
Object Introspection,This involves examining the type or properties of objects at runtime
List vs Tuple,This is a comparison between two data structures in Python the list (which is mutable) and the tuple (which is immutable)
JSON Handling,This pertains to how Python reads or writes data in JSON format
Pass Statement,This is a null operation a place holder often used where code will eventually go but has not been written yet
